# Turtle-Graphics-Drawing-with-Object-Oriented-Programming
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create various shapes using the Python turtle module. The program defines classes such as Point, Box, BoxFilled, Circle, and CircleFilled to encapsulate behavior for drawing and filling shapes at specified coordinates.
